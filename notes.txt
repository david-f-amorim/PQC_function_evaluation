NOTES
=======

----- CODE ISSUES ------
    
IMPROVE NAMING CONVENTION for files 
   
	for large L, epochs : save weights in temp files in between ? to recover data in case interrupted?
		-> add option to start training with existing weights?

!!!!


add more sophisticated binary encoding!!  

 

add better handling of seed 




--- MORE CONCEPTUAL ------

potential long-term scaling issue: need to train for all possible x-inputs? that would require 2^n epochs (exponential!!!)
		--> experiment with excluding states from training!!
