NOTES
=======

----- CODE ISSUES ------
    
add function to recover all temp

add log to catch errors !

add more sophisticated binary encoding!!  

long-term: work towards integration with Fergus' code!

 

--- MORE CONCEPTUAL ------

potential long-term scaling issue: need to train for all possible x-inputs? that would require 2^n epochs (exponential!!!)
		--> experiment with excluding states from training!!


EXPERIMENT WITH LOSS FUNC AND OPTIMIZER ; DO READING !!

THINK ABOUT USING FEWER EPOCHS â€¦ IS THERE EVEN A POINT BEYOND A CERTAIN VALUE ??
