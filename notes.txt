----- CODE ISSUES ------
    
long-term: work towards integration with Fergus' code!

Original work uses 6 qubits for x and 10 for y 


+++++++++++

TRY AND WRITE COMPLETE AMPLITUDE ENCODING ALGORITHM !! DO SOME TESTS WITH AMPL QCNN !!!
	-> plot ampl versus function 

========== 
continue running the quinn computations -> results will allow for direct performance comparison with Fergus' qgan !
=======

INSIGHT: nint=None always ?! ; since value encoded in amplitude not basis state ??!


define custom loss function with loss == mismatch?  loss (x,y) = 1 - |Sum_n (x_n * y_n) | as opposed to MSE loss(x,y) = mean [Sum_n (x_n -y_n)**2]


write function to translate qubit to phase (paper) 

next step: COMPARE BENCHMARK TO LPF !!!
	->> work at a much higher level !! import functions from Fergus !!

possible advantage: much fewer qubits!
