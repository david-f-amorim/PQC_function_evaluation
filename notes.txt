NOTES
=======

----- CODE ISSUES ------
    
IMPROVE NAMING CONVENTION for files 
    -> add meta data (function type!!)

add more sophisticated binary encoding!!    

add better handling of seed 

work with argparser etc 


--- MORE CONCEPTUAL ------

potential long-term scaling issue: need to train for all possible x-inputs? that would require 2^n epochs (exponential!!!)
