----- CODE ISSUES ------
    
long-term: work towards integration with Fergus' code!

Original work uses 6 qubits for x and 10 for y 


+++++++++++

TRY AND WRITE COMPLETE AMPLITUDE ENCODING ALGORITHM !! DO SOME TESTS WITH AMPL QCNN !!!

write function to translate qubit to phase (paper) 

next step: COMPARE BENCHMARK TO LPF !!!
	->> work at a much higher level !! import functions from Fergus !!

possible advantage: much fewer qubits!
