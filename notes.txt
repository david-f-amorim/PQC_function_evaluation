NOTES
=======

----- CODE ISSUES ------
    

add more sophisticated binary encoding!!  

 

add better handling of seed 




--- MORE CONCEPTUAL ------

potential long-term scaling issue: need to train for all possible x-inputs? that would require 2^n epochs (exponential!!!)
		--> experiment with excluding states from training!!
