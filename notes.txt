NOTES
=======

----- CODE ISSUES ------
    
add more sophisticated binary encoding!!  

long-term: work towards integration with Fergus' code!

Original work uses 6 qubits for x and 10 for y 


+++++++++++


next step: COMPARE BENCHMARK TO LPF !!!
	->> work at a much higher level !! import functions from Fergus !!

possible advantage: much fewer qubits!
